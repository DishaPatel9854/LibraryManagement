📚 Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This Java-based application helps manage a library's books and users, offering features like user registration, book searches, reservations, and progress tracking. The system is built using core **OOP** principles, with elements like **Interfaces**, **Inheritance**, and **Multithreading**.

## 🚀 Project Description

The **Library Management System** is designed to help libraries manage book inventories, user registrations, and reservations. It also tracks users' reading progress with notifications at key milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).

This project demonstrates core Java skills like **interfaces**, **inheritance**, and **modular design** using **packages**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **👤 User Registration & Login**: Register and log in to the system.
- **📖 Book Management**: Add, search, and delete books by title or author.
- **🔖 Book Reservation**: Reserve and release books for future reading.
- **⏳ Reading Progress Tracker**: Track and get notifications for reading progress (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%).
- **📡 Observer Pattern**: Get notified when reading progress milestones are hit.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for the system.
- **Packages**: Used to organize the codebase.
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented to track reading progress.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

1. **User Service**: Manages user-related operations such as registration and login.
2. **Book Service**: Handles book operations like adding, deleting, searching, and reserving books.
3. **Reading Progress Tracking**: Uses the observer pattern to notify users of their progress through the book.

The project follows a modular design:
- **`models`**: Contains data classes like `Book` and `User`.
- **`services`**: Implements the logic for managing books and users.
- **`interfaces`**: Defines the contracts for services and observer-subject relationships.
- **`main`**: The entry point for the application.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. **Open** the project in a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. **Run** the `LibraryManagementSystem` class.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Register as a new user or log in with an existing account.
3. Available operations include:
   - **Add** new books to the system.
   - **Search** for books by title or author.
   - **Reserve** a book for future reading.
   - **Track** your reading progress.
   - **Logout** when finished.

## 🏗️ Classes and Interfaces Overview

### Main Classes

- **`LibraryManagementSystem`**: The main class that handles user interactions and the flow of the application.
- **`UserService`**: Manages user registration and login functionality.
- **`BookService`**: Implements `BookServiceInterface` for managing book operations (add, search, delete, etc.).
- **`Book`**: Represents a book entity with details such as title, author, total pages, and reading progress.

### Interfaces

- **`BookServiceInterface`**: Defines the contract for book management functions.
- **`ProgressObserver`**: Interface for tracking reading progress updates.
- **`ProgressSubject`**: Interface for notifying observers of reading progress.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

### Interfaces and Method Overriding

The project uses **interfaces** to define the behavior of services. For example, `BookServiceInterface` is implemented by `BookService`, which provides specific behaviors like adding, deleting, and searching books. **Method overriding** is used to provide customized implementations of interface methods.

### Multithreading

Though basic multithreading isn't in this version, the system is designed to be extended to support multithreaded features like concurrent book reservations and progress tracking.

### Packages and Modular Design

The project is split into packages, promoting clean architecture:
- **`models`**: Contains classes for data representation.
- **`services`**: Handles the logic and business rules of the system.
- **`interfaces`**: Defines essential contracts for services and observers.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Database Integration**: Add support for databases (e.g., MySQL) for persistent data storage.
- **GUI**: Implement a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
- **Advanced Search**: Include filters like genre, year, or availability in the search.
- **Role-based Access**: Add role management for admin and regular users.
